## HTTP Proxy
* when testing web apps, the interaction that happens there is between the browser and the server
* intercepting this communication can help you understand how the application works by intercepting the request and responses and also by modifying them
* this is done through a HTTP Proxy, also called man in the middle proxy
* examples: Burp Suite from PortSwigger, Zed Attack Proxy(ZAP) by OWASP and in Python, MITM


* mapping the target is done by crawlers and spiders (catalogin all the content and functionality of a web app)
* it does this by :
    * following all the links it finds
    * submitting forms
    * analyzing the responses for new content

* examples in Python: Scrapy,HTtrack


## Vulnerability Scanners
* try to automate the entire security testing methodology in one tool
* functions:
    * crawling
    * discovery
    * vulnerability detection
    * exploitation

* examples : w3af, written in Python and Arachni, written in Ruby. Commercial versions: Nessus,Acunetix


## Discovery Tools/Resource Locators
* used with a dictionary attack to find
    * files
    * directories
    * servlets
* examples: Wfuzz,DIRB which uses special wordlists like [FUZZDB](www.github.com/fuzzdb-project)
